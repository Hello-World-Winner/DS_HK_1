# Data Science Course Prework (~10 HOURS):

Congratulations on joining us at General Assembly for the Data Science course! We are so excited to have you and looking forward to working with you all soon!

In order to best prepare you for this course, we’ve gathered a list of resources that we’d like for your to complete prior to beginning the first. So when you arrive on your first day, we will all be up to speed and be familiar with the vocabulary and programming languages necessary to succeed in this course.

Throughout this course, you will be exposed to the Python programming language and various libraries so in order to be most prepared we recommend going through the following downloads and tutorials. 

***This should take you around 7- 10 hours to complete.***

### Prior to the first day of class, please download/install the following:
Python [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) this will install python and the libraries you will need for class, follow the [online install documentation](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html) for instructions

### Prior to first day of class, please complete the following required tutorials:

[LearnPython](http://www.learnpython.org/) (~2 hours)
Complete up through “Learn the Basics” and try your hand at some “Advanced Tutorials.” 

[TryPython](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style.html) (~2 hours) Complete Parts 1 – 3.
Python Style Guide (~1 hour) 

[Learn Pandas](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-
pandas/raw/master/lessons/01%20-%20Lesson.ipynb) (~ 2 hours) 

[Unix/Command line](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
Learn Command Line the Hard Way (~2 hours) 

###Additional Useful Resources:
You won’t need these right away but they will become very useful resources later in the course: [SciPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
