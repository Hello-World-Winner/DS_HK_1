An enjoyable read, Ron, thanks! But since I received a PDF file, I can't add comments inline, so I'll try my best to refer back to the relevant sections of the paper. These are some comments which hopefully would improve your paper, and help you reach a wider audience!

> A linear analysis among the parameters is probably sufficient, i.e. there is no need for sophisticated data manipulation of model training.

That's a very strong claim given that there's no evidence in your paper to suggest as much!
